Asylo is an open framework for developing enclave applications. Asylo lets you
take advantage of a range of emerging trusted execution environments, including
both software and hardware isolation technologies.

Asylo provides:

+   The ability to execute trusted workloads in an untrusted environment,
    inheriting the confidentiality and integrity guarantees from the security
    backend, i.e., the underlying enclave technology.
+   Ready-to-use containers, an open source API, libraries, and tools so you can
    develop and run applications that use one or more enclaves.
+   A choice of security backends.
+   Portability of your application's source code across security backends.
