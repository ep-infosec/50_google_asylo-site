Asylo is the Greek word άσυλο, meaning "safe place" or "sanctuary". The
pronunciation stresses the first A as AH-see-lo (IPA:/'ɑ.sil.oʊ/). <audio

pronunciation.

We felt this name was fitting because Asylo provides a safe place where
applications can run protected from potentially malicious entities that could inspect, corrupt, or attack them without Asylo. Learn more about what Asylo can
provide you on the [about](about.html) and [overview](overview.html) pages.
