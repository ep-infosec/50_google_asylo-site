Asylo provides strong encapsulation around data and logic for developing and
using an enclave. In the Asylo C++ API, an enclave application has trusted and
untrusted components. The API has a central manager object for all hosted
enclave applications.

The following are the main classes for developing and using an enclave.

*   `TrustedApplication` is the trusted component of an enclave application that
    is responsible for sensitive computations.

*   `EnclaveClient` is the untrusted component of an enclave application that is
    responsible for communicating messages with the trusted component.

*   `EnclaveManager` is a singleton object in the untrusted system that is
    responsible for managing enclave lifetimes and shared resources between
    enclaves.

We refer to the process of switching from an untrusted execution environment to
a trusted environment as _entering_ an enclave. Every enclave provides a limited
number of entry points where trusted execution may begin or resume.

## Trusted environment

The trusted environment consists of one or more enclaves, which protect code and
data in a sensitive workload. To create an enclave, define a class which
inherits from `TrustedApplication` and implement the logic to host in the
enclave.

### TrustedApplication class

The `TrustedApplication` class declares methods corresponding to each entry
point defined by the Asylo API.

*   `Initialize` initializes the enclave with configuration values that are
    bound to the enclave's identity. This should be used for security-sensitive
    configuration settings.
*   `Run` takes input messages from the untrusted environment code, performs
    trusted execution, and returns an output message to the untrusted
    environment.
*   `Finalize` takes finalization values from the untrusted environment and is
    called before the enclave is destroyed.

If any of these methods are not overridden, they simply return an `OkStatus`.

## Untrusted environment

The untrusted API provides methods analogous to the enclave entry points that
are defined by a `TrustedApplication`. These methods implement the necessary
machinery to safely cross the enclave boundary. The inputs to these methods are
extensible by the developer.

### EnclaveClient class

The `EnclaveClient` class is responsible for communicating messages with the
trusted component.

*   `EnterAndInitialize` passes enclave configuration settings and optional
    user-defined configuration extensions to the enclave. The configuration
    information is essential to the identity of the enclave.
*   `EnterAndRun` passes an input message to the enclave, and receives an output
    message from the enclave. This method may be called an arbitrary number of
    times with different inputs after the enclave has been initialized.
*   `EnterAndFinalize` passes enclave finalization data to the enclave.

Both `EnterAndInitialize` and `EnterAndFinalize` are private methods that are
called by the friend class `EnclaveManager`.

### EnclaveManager class

The `EnclaveManager` class is responsible for creating and managing enclave
instances. This class is a friend class to `EnclaveClient`.

*   `LoadEnclave` initializes the enclave with a call to `EnterAndInitialize`.

*   `DestroyEnclave` destroys the enclave with a call to `EnterAndFinalize`.

## Entering an enclave from an untrusted execution environment

Entering an enclave is analogous to making a system call. An enclave entry point
implements a gateway to sensitive code with access to the enclave's resources.
Arguments are copied into the enclave on entry and results are copied out on
exit. The following is a snippet from our
[Getting Started]({{home}}/docs/guides/quickstart.html) guide to
writing your first Asylo application.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  absl::ParseCommandLine(argc, argv);

  constexpr char kEnclaveName[] = "demo_enclave";

  const std::string message = absl::GetFlag(FLAGS_message);
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, message.empty()) << "Empty --message flag.";

  const std::string enclave_path = absl::GetFlag(FLAGS_enclave_path);
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, enclave_path.empty()) << "Empty --enclave_path flag.";

  // Part 1: Initialization

  // Prepare |EnclaveManager| with default |EnclaveManagerOptions|
  asylo::EnclaveManager::Configure(asylo::EnclaveManagerOptions());
  auto manager_result = asylo::EnclaveManager::Instance();
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, !manager_result.ok()) << "Could not obtain EnclaveManager";

  // Prepare |load_config| message.
  asylo::EnclaveLoadConfig load_config;
  load_config.set_name(kEnclaveName);

  // Prepare |sgx_config| message.
  auto sgx_config = load_config.MutableExtension(asylo::sgx_load_config);
  sgx_config->set_debug(true);
  auto file_enclave_config = sgx_config->mutable_file_enclave_config();
  file_enclave_config->set_enclave_path(enclave_path);

  // Load Enclave with prepared |EnclaveManager| and |load_config| message.
  asylo::EnclaveManager *manager = manager_result.value();
  auto status = manager->LoadEnclave(load_config);
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, !status.ok()) << "LoadEnclave failed: " << status;

  // Part 2: Secure execution

  // Prepare |input| with |message| and create |output| to retrieve response
  // from enclave.
  asylo::EnclaveInput input;
  asylo::EnclaveOutput output;
  SetEnclaveUserMessage(&input, message);

  // Get |EnclaveClient| for loaded enclave and execute |EnterAndRun|.
  asylo::EnclaveClient *const client = manager->GetClient(kEnclaveName);
  status = client->EnterAndRun(input, &output);
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, !status.ok()) << "EnterAndRun failed with: " << status;

  // Part 3: Finalization

  // |DestroyEnclave| before exiting program.
  asylo::EnclaveFinal empty_final_input;
  status = manager->DestroyEnclave(client, empty_final_input);
  LOG_IF(QFATAL, !status.ok()) << "DestroyEnclave failed with: " << status;

  return 0;
}
```

The three enclave entry points are shown in the above code. Let's go through
each part of the `main()` procedure.

### Part 1: Initialization

The untrusted application performs the following steps to initialize the trusted
application:

1.  Configures an instance of `EnclaveManager` with default options. The
    `EnclaveManager` handles all enclave resources in an untrusted application.
2.  Configures a `EnclaveLoadConfig` object to specify options for the
    SgxLoadConfig to fetch the enclave binary image from disk.
3.  Calls `EnclaveManager::LoadEnclave` to bind the enclave to the name `"demo
    enclave"`. This call implicitly invokes the enclave's `Initialize` method.

### Part 2: Secure execution

The untrusted application performs the following steps to securely execute a
workload in the trusted application:

1.  Provides arbitrary input data in an `EnclaveInput`. This example uses a
    single string protobuf extension to the `EnclaveInput` message. This
    extension field is used to pass data to the enclave for encryption.
2.  Gets a handle to the enclave via `EnclaveManager::GetClient`.
3.  Invokes the enclave by calling `EnclaveClient::EnterAndRun`. This method is
    the primary entry point used to dispatch messages to the enclave. It can be
    called an arbitrary number of times.
4.  Receives the result from the enclave in an `EnclaveOutput`. Developers can
    add protobuf extensions to the `EnclaveOutput` message to provide arbitrary
    output values from their enclave.

### Part 3: Finalization

The untrusted application performs the following steps to finalize the trusted
application:

1.  Provide arbitrary finalization data to the enclave and destroy the enclave
    via `EnclaveManager::DestroyEnclave`.
2.  The Asylo framework will implicitly use the client to call the trusted
    application's `Finalize` method.

## Writing an enclave application

We just saw how to initialize, run, and finalize an enclave using the Asylo SDK.
These calls happen on the untrusted side of the enclave boundary. Now, let's
take a look at the code on the trusted side. Building an enclave consists of
deriving from the `TrustedApplication` class and overriding a number of virtual
methods. Each method defines the logic to be invoked for an
[enclave life cycle](#enclave-life-cycle) event.

```cpp
class EnclaveDemo : public TrustedApplication {
 public:
  EnclaveDemo() = default;

  Status Run(const EnclaveInput &input, EnclaveOutput *output) {
    std::string user_message = GetEnclaveUserMessage(input);
    std::string encrypt_message = EncryptMessage(user_message);
    std::cout << "Encrypted message:" << std::endl
              << encrypt_message << std::endl;
    return absl::OkStatus();
  }

  const std::string GetEnclaveUserMessage(const EnclaveInput &input) {
    return input.GetExtension(enclave_input_test_string).test_string();
  }
```

The class `EnclaveDemo` overrides its parent's `TrustedApplication::Run` method
with its secure execution logic to encrypt a user message. This enclave does not
have any custom initialization or finalization logic, so neither of those
methods are overridden.

## Enclave life cycle

The `TrustedApplication` class implements a model enclave which users may
customize with their application logic. Method input and output parameters are
protobufs defined by the Asylo SDK and are extensible with additional
user-defined content.

### Initialization

The enclave may provide a handler that runs synchronously at the time the
enclave is loaded by `EnclaveManager`.

```
virtual Status TrustedApplication::Initialize(const EnclaveConfig &config);
```

The Asylo framework guarantees this entry point is invoked exactly once, and
that no other thread may enter until this method completes successfully. If
initialization fails and returns a non-OK status, no further entry into the
enclave is possible.

### Execution

After initialization has succeeded, threads may enter the enclave and run the
following handler via the client method `EnclaveClient::EnterAndRun`:

```
virtual Status TrustedApplication::Run(const EnclaveInput &input,
                                       EnclaveOutput *output);
```

Many threads may invoke this entry point in parallel, so its implementation of
`Run` must be thread safe. The application author is responsible for ensuring
that concurrent access to data is managed appropriately.

### Finalization

The last category of enclave entry is finalization.

```
virtual Status TrustedApplication::Finalize(const EnclaveFinal &final);
```

The Asylo runtime will make a best-effort attempt to invoke the enclave
finalization entry point when either of the following occurs:

*   Untrusted code destroys the enclave by calling
    `EnclaveManager::DestroyEnclave`.

*   The host application exits and the `EnclaveManager` itself is finalized.

The Asylo runtime guarantees that no further entry into the enclave is possible
after finalization.

Note that in the case the enclave exits abnormally, or in the event the
untrusted runtime is compromised, it is not possible to guarantee that
`Finalize` is invoked. Applications should not rely on `Finalize` for
correctness or for security.
